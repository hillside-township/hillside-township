         <h3>Newsletter | December 14th Release | Hillside Township</h3>
         <h4>Politics</h4>
         <strong>Politicians answer vaguely</strong>
         <p>Politics in Hillside have come to a standstill! Despite our best efforts the election has not yet happened and no virtual Hillside has been made. Hillside now only survives on <a href="https://hillside-township.github.io/">our website</a> and in this newsletter. Even with all the <a href="https://github.com/Squirrel-314/glish-translate">other</a> <a href="https://github.com/Squirrel-314">totally</a> <a href="https://squirrel-314.github.io/">important</a> work I have to do, and all the actually totally important work I have to do, I am still trying to send you this newsletter every other week.</p>

         <h4>News</h4>
         <strong>Sphere Earth Protest Get Out of Hand!</strong>
         <p> I'd like to make it clear before I start that I do not believe in any of this sphere Earth nonsense. Sadly, some of our citizens do, and all of them are stubbornly stuck in their backwards ways. Lately the sphere Earth protest and marches have gotten more extreme. Protesters call out dehumanizing words at non-believers, as well as waving their pointless diagrams of obviously false pictures of Earth. Hillside scientist Plai Jraized stated his opinion on this earlier. "I just can't believe that anyone still believes in those antiquated ideas. Who could ever believe in that ludicrous balderdash and malarky after all of the scientific proof! Those are the type of people that believe in inalienable human rights and that blatherskite." It's amazing to see how many people who are too stuck in their ways to believe reality. And for those poor, poor, misinformed people who believe in that sphere Earth ideology, hopefully <a href="https://cube-earth-society.github.io/">this evidence</a> will convince you to believe in the reality of things.</p>

         <h4>Business and Economy</h4>
         <strong>Stocks, y'all!</strong>
         <p> As you all know, for years our best hackers have been working on trying to hack the stock market, until now, unsuccessfully. There have been numerous attempts to hijack stock markets trades, all of them ending up with the federal government arresting someone. But now, a champion hacker of Hillside, Brecan D. Webb, has finally succeeded in breaking the web. Two days ago at 2 o'clock A.M. Brecan was clicking furiously at his keyboard in a dark room mumbling ineligible nonsense when suddenly he cried "Eureka, I've got it!". The press was irritated he could think of any exclamation more original, and that he repeated the same word twice but in two languages. "Really! It's not like anyone speaks Latin anymore. Quod partum populus." grumbled a news reporter. But after complaining in Latin the press was quite excited about such an interesting story. It appears that he managed to increase the stock value of a Hillside company by 0.29%. The company, a certain Scam Likely was so grateful they gave him some free stocks. We are all amazed at this feat of... technological skill and send our praise and Hillside government security to Brecan D. Webb.</p>

         <h4>Science</h4>
         <strong>What happens if I mix these? **Boom**</strong>
         <p>More breakthroughs in mathematics! Mathematicians-philosophers in the greater Hillside area have been questioning numbers for years, and finally they are getting back results. After years of scientific research they have finally discovered the missing number they've been looking for all along. This week the researchers announced the discovery of the number between 3 and 4. So far they don't have very much information on it, but there will be more about it in the next release.</p>

         <h4>Sports</h4>
         <strong>SCORE!!!</strong>
         <p>The time has finally arrived for Hillside Greater Chess Championships! All year minor chess championships have been occurring, along with directly related disappearances/fatalities/sudden retirement of out-of-favor players. These championships were all kindly funded by the Hillside government itself which clearly indicated ulterior motives, which of course only makes more people interested in competing. Only the best of the best, or by other words the most well funded, players reach the final championships and compete against each other, Hillside's computer program CHESS, which stands for CHESS: Hillside's Extremely Sufficient Supercomputer, and the Mayor himself. For those who like conspiracy theories, government officials have told me to let you know that the fact that every Hillside Mayor won the Greater Chess Championships may or may not be coincidental. That being said, I hope you enjoy watching the chess championships!</p>

         <h4>Special</h4>
         <strong>Extra, Extra!</strong>
         <p>On Monday, November 30, 2020, a new type of plant was discovered in Hillside. Randy, the annoying invisible man that no one talks about, discovered a new plant by tripping, falling on it and eventually dying from it. Witnesses claim the plant strangled him to death because of his annoyingness. The has been officially named "humanity when aggravated," and scientists that named it are calling for precaution for anyone annoying enough to get strangled by a plant.</p>

         <h3>Newsletter | November 30th Release | Hillside Township</h3>
         <h4>Politics</h4>
         <strong>Politicians answer vaguely</strong>
         <p>Guess what? The new Hillside election will be happening soon! You’re probably wondering: ‘How?’ Well, here to tell you how, is Hillside second-in command Scout Trooper 15. “The election will be held soon, I haven’t planned that out yet, but they will happen, obviously. We can either have them via Zoom, or have the citizens mail them in, or we can mix it up and hold elections on a Wednesday when they will be here.” He states. However, with the lockdown the last option will not be possible. Our Mayor Squirrel thinks the best solutions may be email, and here's why: "With Disqus anyone could make a false account and put in multiple votes, and the problem with Zoom is a lack of privacy. The main problem in these virtual times is staying connected, and that is our problem." How true those last words were. Not even all the Hillside citizens are subscribed to this newsletter, and we have no way to contact them. The citizens of Hillside are strong together, but apart they can do nothing to hold their town together. Our best hope is to keep connected.</p>

         <h4>News</h4>
         <strong>Hillside: The crumbling economy?</strong>
         <p>After the last elections where current Mayor Squirrel was elected, 75% Of Hillsidians voted for Squirrel. The only problem? No one cared. Why vote a President when you don't care? The surprising thing is that this also happened during Hillside's last election. After the elections, Hillside's economy dropped dramatically. Stocks fell, and houses fell apart. The under-construction WSM (Whacking Stick Museum) fell apart due to the lack of materials and hands to help.</p>

         <h4>Business and Economy</h4>
         <strong>Stocks, y'all!</strong>
         <p>Hillsides economy crashes with no one to care for the town! With no one in the town due to the new lockdown, trash has stacked up, and huge shipments of lumber are taking up room, making it impossible to walk. Market Road Has started to become overgrown, and the entrance to it has started to disappear forever, while plants are taking over paths making it seem as if no one ever lived there at all. Businesses are closing permanently, of course excluding the government favoured ones.</p>

         <p>Continuing with Hillside Basketball, current Star Imthe Best breaks several of the dirt scrapers ankles during Saturday's game! Referees ban her.
         “Why? I was just playing!” She claims, even after video tape of her shoving them. Judges debate whether to put her in jail. However, even with this interference, the Hillside team moves on, determined to win, by hook or by crook...</p>

         <h4>Special</h4>
         <strong>A virtual Hillside?</strong>
         <p>With the new COVID-19 lockdown, Hillside is struggling more than ever to keep above water. it has gone through various attempts to rescue the town economy, such as giving favoured companies extra funds and making wifi free. However, it seems like we won't make it through-in person. A while ago a newspaper article was written about Hillside going online, and now it may be that it shall become a reality. It is becoming of more urgency to find a way to put that plan into action, and all of our best minds are working on ideas, and we hope that if you get an idea you can share it with us either by responding to this email or putting a comment on Disqus on Hillsides main site. We have gone over a few ideas, however none of them are ideal. If Hillside does not move online, it could be forgotten and be swept aside to the dustbin of history, and this newsletter would be no more. We hope you can help us help Hillside help us all.</p>

       <h3>Newsletter | November 16th Release | Hillside Township</h3>
       <h4>Politics</h4>
       <strong>Politicians answer vaguely</strong>
       <p>Politicians answer vaguely to the question we've been asking: what of the elections? According to the Mayor's Second in Command, due to some difficulties the elections must be held online. However, even that response was vague. He gave no hint as to how the elections were to be held, although they will surely let us know soon. I shall probably be sending an email some time this week updating the news about the election.</p>
       <p>The Mayor is planning to pass a new law, which firmly encourages people to use solar panels instead of gas and completely and thoroughly bans further extraction of natural gases and fossil fuels and permanently shuts down all companies that dabble in these dark and dangerous doings. The new law will also give 1.9% percent tax cuts to homes using solar panels. Considering the fact that Hillside does not have taxes makes this slightly less appling and slightly more confusing. Solar companies are encouraged by government intervention and large sums of money given to selective companies that the Mayor favors.</p>

       <h4>News</h4>
       <strong>Lawsuit ends in Havoc!</strong>
       <p> Last week, Mr. Eurar Wolcome filed a lawsuit against the protesters who inconsiderately demolished his 5 star hotel. "It's preposterous!" he said to reporters. "Where did they even get those siege weapons from? It's illegal to have unregistered battering rams!" He immediately brought the case to the High Hillside Court, and because of the very small amount of cases actually important enough to go to the court, they gathered to listen to his cse in two hours. The Judge listened to both sides, the representative of the protesters being a random waiter who knew absolutely nothing about law, and their lawyer being the lawyer the court reserves for people who cannot afford a real lawyer who actually got a law degree. The Judge looked over the evidence and occasionally looked at people threateningly for five minutes then told everyone the decision. "According to our benevolent laws, it is a crime to do what these protesters have done. They have broken law number 2, 'Breaking and entering any building without the consent of the owner. This rule may only be broken by the Police, Firefighter,  Mayor, and Second in Command.', law 7, 'Destroying or sabotaging others’ work.', law 9, 'Yeeting items of importance.', and law 14, which will stay undisclosed but can be viewed on Hillside's official website. One again I would remind you all that these laws are not a joke and should actually be followed, however we are working to change some of the more ridiculous one." here the Judge paused to glare at the Mayor, then continued "So therefore I use the power entrusted to me by the government to judge these protesters guilty. Their punishment shall be-" and here the venerable Judge was interrupted by a battering ram smashing through the wall of the court, causing havoc and panic with everyone running around and screaming. The Judge tried to bring quiet by banging his gavel and screaming while trying to stay dignified, and the Mayor's companions, the same mysterious people dressed in black that were with the Mayor during the protest, brought control to the situation by holding everyone at swordpoint. In the end the Chief of Police came and took all the protesters to the penitentiary while the Judge decided their new and extended sentance.</p>

       <h4>Business and Economy</h4>
       <strong>Stocks, y'all!</strong>
       <p>It seems that the economy seems to be continuing at... suboptimal levels. Stock scientists(are there stock scientists? The people that came to my office definitely looked suspicious) are still looking for the cause of this decrease, which started about February of this year. "I wonder what could be causing this?" Says reporter after reporting increase in COVID-19 cases. Our Mayor confidently reassured us then went back to urgently talking to a mysterious man dressed in black, not unlike the people from last week. The stock scientists have theories that the bear market may be due to the introduction of 5G internet, but as of now they have no evidence to support this hypothesis.</p>
       <p>Alternatively, solar panel companies are doing fabulously. It seems that everyone is switching to solar in anticipation of the new law, which will come with many lagniappes for people with solar panels and minor repercussions for people without. Invest in solar stocks while you can! PS do not take that advice seriously. I am not a professional in stocks and am not to be trusted since I work in the media which is controlled by the government.</p>

       <h4>Sports</h4>
       <strong>SCORE!!!</strong>
       <p> This time it's basketball season, and Hillside's best team has the world record for cheating in basketball! Every year, over half of the players get disqualified, a record many have found hard to beat. Referees around the world continue to demand the disbanding of the team due to their atrocious behavior. The coach of the Bounding Spheroids, the basketball team, says the other coaches are just upset they don't have such good players. "If they had our players they wouldn't be complaining! Well, maybe they would, but, our team is the best! Wait a minute, are you writing this down?" he said when interviewed earlier today. He says he plans on winning all other teams in Hillside. Due to Hillside's semi city state status there are not many other teams in Hillside, but this does not bother the coach. "We've been practicing everything, from tripping opponents to moral discouragement, which is effective but surprisingly allowed." I understand how some believe that the coach is the cause of the trouble.</p>

        <h4>News</h4>
        <strong>Protests in town center knock over hotel!</strong>
        <p>Earlier this week, citizens protesting against the new watch towers, which I wrote an article about <a href="https://hillside-township.github.io/HTML/news.html">here</a>, stormed through town center and screamed at the empty city hall building. For all who do not know, the city hall building is a decoy for the real city hall building, it's location not disclosed. Oh, sorry, you aren't supposed to know the building is a decoy. Forget I said that. So the protesters gathered in the town center, screaming at and throwing paper towels at the definitely not a decoy totally not empty city hall. The mayor emerged from the secret subway system(sss), which you don't know about, flanked by mysterious figures dressed in black, with shiny black shoes, black overcoats, black bowler hats, and black sunglasses. The mayor implored the crowd to stop and listen, to little avail. When the objects being thrown increased in mass and weight, with microwaves and 50 pound weights and living room couches and 1971 Volkswagen Beetles, the mayor promptly retreated into the Welcome Inn, Hillside's most important hotel. From the depths of the crowd a battering ram appeared, and the angry protesters drew other siege weapons from some unknown place within the mob. The crowd may have been a bit over exited and went too far, because that trebuchet was totally unnecessary. The hotel was completely flattened, but the mayor was nowhere to be found, most probably having retreated to the SSS. Mr. Eurar Wolcome is extremely disappointed at the destruction of his hotel, and is currently suing the protesters collectively in our completely totally unbiased court. We'll let you know more about this next week.</p>

        <h4>Business and Economy</h4>
        <strong>Stocks, y'all!</strong>
        <p>Hillside's scam call company, Scam Likely, has just had a leap in successful scam calls! Their stocks are going up quite a bit, and all of the people who somehow thought that buying stocks in a scam company was a good idea just got more than their money back! Wow, I wish I had not bought actually sensible stocks with clear results. Scientists believe that the increase in accepted calls may or may not be related to the fact that they changed the name that came up on calls from scams likely to Mom. That's what I call marketing. So, lesson learned, next time I'll invest in unlikely companies with... unusual services and products.</p>

        <h4>Sports</h4>
        <strong>SCORE!!!</strong>
        <p>It's tennis season! Our professional tennis teams are doing quite well. Our best team, the Light Green Orb Whackers, has gone up to the state level, with some... good scores. The exact numbers are hidden, and no one seems to have seen their games, but I guess they are doing well! And anyway, no one can even question their victories, since the members are all very successful lawyers. Anyway, if you actually go to one of their games, please let me know!</p>
