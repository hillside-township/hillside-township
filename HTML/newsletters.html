        <h4>News</h4>
        <strong>Protests in town center knock over hotel!</strong>
        <p>Earlier this week, citizens protesting against the new watch towers, which I wrote an article about <a href="https://hillside-township.github.io/HTML/news.html">here</a>, stormed through town center and screamed at the empty city hall building. For all who do not know, the city hall building is a decoy for the real city hall building, it's location not disclosed. Oh, sorry, you aren't supposed to know the building is a decoy. Forget I said that. So the protesters gathered in the town center, screaming at and throwing paper towels at the definitely not a decoy totally not empty city hall. The mayor emerged from the secret subway system(sss), which you don't know about, flanked by mysterious figures dressed in black, with shiny black shoes, black overcoats, black bowler hats, and black sunglasses. The mayor implored the crowd to stop and listen, to little avail. When the objects being thrown increased in mass and weight, with microwaves and 50 pound weights and living room couches and 1971 Volkswagen Beetles, the mayor promptly retreated into the Welcome Inn, Hillside's most important hotel. From the depths of the crowd a battering ram appeared, and the angry protesters drew other siege weapons from some unknown place within the mob. The crowd may have been a bit over exited and went too far, because that trebuchet was totally unnecessary. The hotel was completely flattened, but the mayor was nowhere to be found, most probably having retreated to the SSS. Mr. Eurar Wolcome is extremely disappointed at the destruction of his hotel, and is currently suing the protesters collectively in our completely totally unbiased court. We'll let you know more about this next week.</p>

        <h4>Business and Economy</h4>
        <strong>Stocks, y'all!</strong>
        <p>Hillside's scam call company, Scam Likely, has just had a leap in successful scam calls! Their stocks are going up quite a bit, and all of the people who somehow thought that buying stocks in a scam company was a good idea just got more than their money back! Wow, I wish I had not bought actually sensible stocks with clear results. Scientists believe that the increase in accepted calls may or may not be related to the fact that they changed the name that came up on calls from scams likely to Mom. That's what I call marketing. So, lesson learned, next time I'll invest in unlikely companies with... unusual services and products.</p>

        <h4>Sports</h4>
        <strong>SCORE!!!</strong>
        <p>It's tennis season! Our professional tennis teams are doing quite well. Our best team, the Light Green Orb Whackers, has gone up to the state level, with some... good scores. The exact numbers are hidden, and no one seems to have seen their games, but I guess they are doing well! And anyway, no one can even question their victories, since the members are all very successful lawyers. Anyway, if you actually go to one of their games, please let me know!</p>
