       <h4>Politics</h4>
       <strong>Politicians answer vaguely</strong>
       <p>Politicians answer vaguely to the question we've been asking: what of the elections? According to the Mayor's Second in Command, due to some difficulties the elections must be held online. However, even that response was vague. He gave no hint as to how the elections were to be held, although they will surely let us know soon. I shall probably be sending an email some time this week updating the news about the election.</p>
       <p>The Mayor is planning to pass a new law, which firmly encourages people to use solar panels instead of gas and completely and thoroughly bans further extraction of natural gases and fossil fuels and permanently shuts down all companies that dabble in these dark and dangerous doings. The new law will also give 1.9% percent tax cuts to homes using solar panels. Considering the fact that Hillside does not have taxes makes this slightly less appling and slightly more confusing. Solar companies are encouraged by government intervention and large sums of money given to selective companies that the Mayor favors.</p>

       <strong>Lawsuit ends in Havoc!</strong>
       <p> Last week, Mr. Eurar Wolcome filed a lawsuit against the protesters who inconsiderately demolished his 5 star hotel. "It's preposterous!" he said to reporters. "Where did they even get those siege weapons from? It's illegal to have unregistered battering rams!" He immediately brought the case to the High Hillside Court, and because of the very small amount of cases actually important enough to go to the court, they gathered to listen to his cse in two hours. The Judge listened to both sides, the representative of the protesters being a random waiter who knew absolutely nothing about law, and their lawyer being the lawyer the court reserves for people who cannot afford a real lawyer who actually got a law degree. The Judge looked over the evidence and occasionally looked at people threateningly for five minutes then told everyone the decision. "According to our benevolent laws, it is a crime to do what these protesters have done. They have broken law number 2, 'Breaking and entering any building without the consent of the owner. This rule may only be broken by the Police, Firefighter,  Mayor, and Second in Command.', law 7, 'Destroying or sabotaging othersâ€™ work.', law 9, 'Yeeting items of importance.', and law 14, which will stay undisclosed but can be viewed on Hillside's official website. One again I would remind you all that these laws are not a joke and should actually be followed, however we are working to change some of the more ridiculous one." here the Judge paused to glare at the Mayor, then continued "So therefore I use the power entrusted to me by the government to judge these protesters guilty. Their punishment shall be-" and here the venerable Judge was interrupted by a battering ram smashing through the wall of the court, causing havoc and panic with everyone running around and screaming. The Judge tried to bring quiet by banging his gavel and screaming while trying to stay dignified, and the Mayor's companions, the same mysterious people dressed in black that were with the Mayor during the protest, brought control to the situation by holding everyone at swordpoint. In the end the Chief of Police came and took all the protesters to the penitentiary while the Judge decided their new and extended sentance.</p>

       <h4>Business and Economy</h4>
       <strong>Stocks, y'all!</strong>
       <p>It seems that the economy seems to be continuing at... suboptimal levels. Stock scientists(are there stock scientists? The people that came to my office definitely looked suspicious) are still looking for the cause of this decrease, which started about February of this year. "I wonder what could be causing this?" Says reporter after reporting increase in COVID-19 cases. Our Mayor confidently reassured us then went back to urgently talking to a mysterious man dressed in black, not unlike the people from last week. The stock scientists have theories that the bear market may be due to the introduction of 5G internet, but as of now they have no evidence to support this hypothesis.</p>
       <p>Alternatively, solar panel companies are doing fabulously. It seems that everyone is switching to solar in anticipation of the new law, which will come with many lagniappes for people with solar panels and minor repercussions for people without. Invest in solar stocks while you can! PS do not take that advice seriously. I am not a professional in stocks and am not to be trusted since I work in the media which is controlled by the government.</p>

       <h4>Sports</h4>
       <strong>SCORE!!!</strong>
       <p> This time it's basketball season, and Hillside's best team has the world record for cheating in basketball! Every year, over half of the players get disqualified, a record many have found hard to beat. Referees around the world continue to demand the disbanding of the team due to their atrocious behavior. The coach of the Bounding Spheroids, the basketball team, says the other coaches are just upset they don't have such good players. "If they had our players they wouldn't be complaining! Well, maybe they would, but, our team is the best! Wait a minute, are you writing this down?" he said when interviewed earlier today. He says he plans on winning all other teams in Hillside. Due to Hillside's semi city state status there are not many other teams in Hillside, but this does not bother the coach. "We've been practicing everything, from tripping opponents to moral discouragement, which is effective but surprisingly allowed." I understand how some believe that the coach is the cause of the trouble.</p>

        <h4>News</h4>
        <strong>Protests in town center knock over hotel!</strong>
        <p>Earlier this week, citizens protesting against the new watch towers, which I wrote an article about <a href="https://hillside-township.github.io/HTML/news.html">here</a>, stormed through town center and screamed at the empty city hall building. For all who do not know, the city hall building is a decoy for the real city hall building, it's location not disclosed. Oh, sorry, you aren't supposed to know the building is a decoy. Forget I said that. So the protesters gathered in the town center, screaming at and throwing paper towels at the definitely not a decoy totally not empty city hall. The mayor emerged from the secret subway system(sss), which you don't know about, flanked by mysterious figures dressed in black, with shiny black shoes, black overcoats, black bowler hats, and black sunglasses. The mayor implored the crowd to stop and listen, to little avail. When the objects being thrown increased in mass and weight, with microwaves and 50 pound weights and living room couches and 1971 Volkswagen Beetles, the mayor promptly retreated into the Welcome Inn, Hillside's most important hotel. From the depths of the crowd a battering ram appeared, and the angry protesters drew other siege weapons from some unknown place within the mob. The crowd may have been a bit over exited and went too far, because that trebuchet was totally unnecessary. The hotel was completely flattened, but the mayor was nowhere to be found, most probably having retreated to the SSS. Mr. Eurar Wolcome is extremely disappointed at the destruction of his hotel, and is currently suing the protesters collectively in our completely totally unbiased court. We'll let you know more about this next week.</p>

        <h4>Business and Economy</h4>
        <strong>Stocks, y'all!</strong>
        <p>Hillside's scam call company, Scam Likely, has just had a leap in successful scam calls! Their stocks are going up quite a bit, and all of the people who somehow thought that buying stocks in a scam company was a good idea just got more than their money back! Wow, I wish I had not bought actually sensible stocks with clear results. Scientists believe that the increase in accepted calls may or may not be related to the fact that they changed the name that came up on calls from scams likely to Mom. That's what I call marketing. So, lesson learned, next time I'll invest in unlikely companies with... unusual services and products.</p>

        <h4>Sports</h4>
        <strong>SCORE!!!</strong>
        <p>It's tennis season! Our professional tennis teams are doing quite well. Our best team, the Light Green Orb Whackers, has gone up to the state level, with some... good scores. The exact numbers are hidden, and no one seems to have seen their games, but I guess they are doing well! And anyway, no one can even question their victories, since the members are all very successful lawyers. Anyway, if you actually go to one of their games, please let me know!</p>

        <p>Let us know if you like this newsletter, so we can continue producing it!</p>
