		<h1>Cat Meows at Tall Grass</h1>
		<h3>Can the precious grass be saved?</h3>
		<p>The prestigious math Professor Radical Numburrs was taking his early morning stroll when he saw his neighbor’s cat meowing at the town’s only prized clump of real grass. And even worse, the cat, Mister Meowzworth, NIBBLED A BIT OF THE GRASS! This coming Tuesday the Chief Police, Keenan Chandler, is going to put Mister Meowzworth on trial for this unforgivable infringement of the law. Currently, all the police are busy thinking of how to punish Mister Meowzworth since the usual method does not apply for cats. They are thinking of something along the lines some years in prison, but the trouble is he might slip through the bars. Meanwhile Hillside has hired the world’s greatest botanist to see if they can heal the precious clump of grass.</p>

		<h1>New Plant Discovered</h1>
		<h3>High Economic Value</h3>
		<p>Explorer Awsum Diskcovries found a new plant when adventuring in the jungles of Hillside. He describes it as; “Big. Kinda Green. Big. Planty. Did I say big?” The best part about this plant is not its square leaves, or roots that grow along a grid. It is the fruit. This new plant, called the Wait..what? tree  has pakoras as fruit. Many people are sceptical, but as proof Awsum Diskcovries took a potted plant to the Pope, who now firmly believes in the plant. This could be great for the economy, but it might completely dislodge the chickpea, spinach, and spices businesses. Chickpea, spinach, and spices farmers are having riots claiming that the tree should be banned. Hillside botanist Photo Snthasis says this is going to be awesome. “This is great! This proves my theory that we can grow processed foods! In a couple of years we can hybridize it to stretch to all fried food! Imagine, going into  your backyard and picking and eating fresh fries straight off the tree!” This may sound a bit optimistic, but many other botanists agree. One day we might be eating fried food straight off a tree. Just imagine that. Healthy people aren't going to be happy. I’m not a healthy person.</p>

    <h1>Really Quite Old Paper Found</h1>
    <h3>Major Historic Discoveries</h3>
    <p>A really old document was found in the Hillside area by math professor Radical Numburrs. After three weeks of no sleep, during which scientists sat trying to decode it, Radical Numburrs walked in and flipped the paper, thus ‘decoding’ the paper. After spending quite a bit of money carbon dating it, Radical Numburrs found the date written at the top of the paper, 3.1415 B.Y.E. (Before Y’all Existed), making this paper the oldest sign of sentience in existence. Scientists are still trying to figure out exactly when that was. Historians favor the idea that the paper was written “rather quite a while ago, old chap.” Historian Loang Agoe says “This will lead the way to major historic discoveries. *cough* *cough* I just have a common cold, that’s all. Nothing serious. *cough* *cough* Anyway, this paper could teach us things about the past we never could have learned otherwise.” read more about this document in the next edition of this newspaper.</p>

		<h1>Trilobite Park Opening</h1>
		<h3>Grand Opening May 12</h3>
		<p>The town scientist, John Hammond, after a horribly publicized  crushing defeat in trying to bring back dinosaurs, had settled down in Hillside for retirement. He was pulled out of retirement by the discovery of a bit of fossilized trilobite DNA in the Hillside area.He has decided to go back to the drawing board, and after nearly two years Trilobite Park is ready to open. The first two months are already completely booked, and thousands are flocking to Hillside to see what scientists call ‘our oldest ancestors’. It’s great for local business, and many small businesses are thriving. All those places that sell useless tourist stuff like postcards and plastic thingamajobs are suddenly getting customers. The government, who has been trying to put them out of business for years, is still sulking. Local hotels are also doing well. “Business is booming, and I've finally got enough money to buy that mansion with 90 billion acres. It’s great, just the people who stay in my hotel complain about the lack of restrooms. I mean, really, who needs those?” Says the owner of Hillsides’ biggest hotel, the Welcome Inn (pun most definitely intended), Mr. Eurar Wolcome. I'm just saying that I’m not going until they make sure the Jurassic Park incident does not reoccur...</p>

    <h1>Scientist Redefine Flora</h1>
    <h3>Grand Opening May 12</h3>
    <p>Hillside’s most prominent botanist, Photo Snthasis, came back from the International Green Growing Stuff Convention just last Wednesday. When I interviewed him he was so excited I could hardly keep up. “Mole D. Plantes, the famous guy who gives latin names for all the new plants, invited the world's leading nomenclaturist Namen Thingz for a special announcement about nomenclature stuff. </p>

    <h1>Hillside’s Museum Collapses!</h1>
    <h3>Can we fix it?</h3>
    <p>The newly under construction building we all knew as the Whacking Stick Museum has collapsed! Workers have inspected the wreckage and discovered the cause of this mass destruction; weather and wind. The destruction is fatal, and the head of building, Hamza Nasher, and his moderation team are still discussing the options. To fix it, they would need a lot more supplies and material, which is starting to get scarce, due to the new towns in the area. Another obstacle in the way of the continuation of building is the Covid-19 virus that has immobilised schools and forced people to stay inside. If construction would continue, it would not start until the fall of 2020. This is a huge hit on Hillside, and we might not recover from this devastating blow.  “It’s just truly horrible.” says chief of construction Hamza Nasher. The town Mayor, Sabyne Ticknor is notified of this and is trying to find a solution to this problem as fast as possible, but with the summer approaching fast, it’s clear that Hillside may never recover. </p>
