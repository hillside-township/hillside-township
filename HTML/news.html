		<h1>Cat Meows at Tall Grass!</h1>
		<h3>Can the precious grass be saved?</h3>
		<p>The prestigious math Professor Radical Numburrs was taking his early morning stroll when he saw his neighbor’s cat meowing at the town’s only prized clump of real grass. And even worse, the cat, Mister Meowzworth, NIBBLED A BIT OF THE GRASS! This coming Tuesday the Chief Police, Keenan Chandler, is going to put Mister Meowzworth on trial for this unforgivable infringement of the law. Currently, all the police are busy thinking of how to punish Mister Meowzworth since the usual method does not apply for cats. They are thinking of something along the lines some years in prison, but the trouble is he might slip through the bars. Meanwhile Hillside has hired the world’s greatest botanist to see if they can heal the precious clump of grass.</p>
