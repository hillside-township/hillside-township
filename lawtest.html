    <h1>Hillside Village Township Laws</h1>
    <p>10 Jan. 2020<br>Originally Drafted by Justin McCubbin, Keenen Chandler, Hamza Nasher, Sabyne Ticknor, Lucy Lyon, and Ella Schlosser</p>
    <h2>Overview<h2>
      <p>For the record, Hillside© is copyrighted. This is the 2020 version of the laws and regulations for Hillside Township and, subsequently, the HOA(RC). Document and legal rights subject to change at any time for any reason. Any changes that will jeopardize the future editing of this document needs the support of every single HOA member, a unanimous vote. Issues may be brought up with the secretary or person in charge of that particular field. Sarcasm is the official language of Hillside and is always encouraged. Glish, on the other hand, is fully and thoroughly banned. Any speak of it shall be a week’s sentence. All citizens must read this paper at least once per quarter.</p>
     <h2>Land Usage</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Land may be granted by agreement of officials with the plot surveyed by the contractor and request applied for by the citizen in question. The applicant will receive a copy of the certificate and the other copy will be put in the Binder.</li>
        <li>Land may be used for the reasons of storage or housing, and one person or group can only hold one plot for personal benefit/use.</li>
        <li>Community structures can be suggested to the Architect and approved by the HOA(RC)(Hillside Owners Association(Residents Committee)).</li>
        <li>Construction of a new building can be a community activity and  citizens should be allowed to help unless the builder(s) do not want them to.</li>
        <li>A map of all plots and ownership must be kept in the Record Binder and updated by the Architect under every mayor.</li>
        <li>The destruction or reconstruction of a building must be unanimously voted on by the HOA.</li>
        <li>All houses will be inspected by the Mayor and/or their Second-in-Command weekly.</li>
        <li>If citizens wants to design their own house they must seek permission from the HOA</li>
        <li>All land belongs to the HOA and will be distributed at their command.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Law System</h2>
      <p>The Hillside justice system is composed of the following; the Mayor and HOA, the Judge, and the Lawyers. A Lawyer is not needed but strongly advised by the government officials, who I can’t promise were not bribed by the lawyers (hey, it was a good deal). This brings me to bribes. Bribes are accepted in any way, shape or form, but ONLY government officials can ‘legally’ accept them. The judge runs all cases in the HCC and the HOA meetings. If any rule below has been broken, it instantly becomes a case to be investigated by the Police.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Robbing the property of fellow citizens.</li>
        <li>Breaking and entering any building without the consent of the owner. This rule may only be broken by the Police, Firefighter,  Mayor, and Second in Command.</li>
        <li>Tricking someone to your advantage.</li>
        <li>Bloody or non-bloody murder (icicle-suggested technique).</li>
        <li>Cold blooded murder.</li>
        <li>Murder without incentive or reason.</li>
        <li>Destroying or sabotaging others’ work.</li>
        <li>Mutilation of each other.</li>
        <li>Yeeting items of importance.</li>
        <li>Entering areas closed to construction.</li>
        <li>Tax fraud and money laundering.</li>
        <li>Biting, scratching, kicking, snatching.</li>
        <li>Abuse in general (keep it vague).</li>
        <li>Freedom, liberty, and justice for the peasants.</li>
        <li>Fake Candy and Fake Fruit.</li>
        <li>Rotten joy.</li>
        <li>Managing to contain the 2019-NoCv.</li>
        <li>Breaking treaties of any kind.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The Judge may decide aquadate punishment for each crime. Your criminal records will be kept by the Police officer FOREVER. These rules are in effect throughout Hillside.</p>
      <h2>CURRENCY</h2>
      <ol><!--
        Type and value of the object of monetary value must be universally agreed upon.
Money laundering and taxation is unnecessary when not and therefore illegal business.
Trade is applicable when both sides are in mutual agreement.
Any major exchange must be known and approved by the Mayor/HOA.
Small trades or purchases at the market do not have to be approved.
      </ol>-->
      <h2>HILLSIDE COMMUNITY CENTER </h2>
      <p>The Hillside Community Center (HCC) is the town hall and is used for community HOA meetings, votes, and is home to the Court, Fire station and Police station. The building must be booked for resident activities such as performances, classes, bible readings, etc. Classes can be monetized. The HCC is also the multi-religion center and the office for the HOA.</p>
