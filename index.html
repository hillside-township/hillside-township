				<h1>The News Gym</h1>
				<h3>HOA Votes to Open Gym!</h3>
				<p>	The time we have all been waiting for has come: The HOA has finally agreed to make a city gym! As we all know, for years the HOA has been delaying the decision due to financial reasons, which may or may not include the fact that all HOA members live in luxury apartments in the best parts of town. But now, they have put aside their personal needs and will sacrifice their own wellbeing to make sure this town has a gym! It shall be located on Sassafras Lane, near the Murky Donut Shop. The official opening ceremony is this coming Monday! There is only one small setback. The HOA has posted a notice that states the following:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The gym is not for exercise</li>
					<li>No one is to approach the gym</li>
					<li>Avert your gaze from the wraiths</li>
					<li>Disappearances are to be expected</li>
					<li>Ignore the screams</li>
					<li>DO NOT ENTER THE GYM</li>
					<li>run.</li>
					<li>Run.</li>
					<li>RUN.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Like I said, only a small setback. The gym will be a place to hold big events, give lectures, and have an excruciatingly painful demise. I just can’t wait until it opens!</p>

				<h1>Mysterious Watch Towers</h1>
				<h3>From Where do These Wathchtowers Come?</h3>
				<p>	Many citizens are worried about the mysterious dark watch towers that have been erected around the edge of town. When interviewed about the watchtowers, the HOA stated that they were there to protect Hillside from the dark creatures that prowl the surrounding forest at night. They did not bother to explain how over twenty towers were built in a single night. Another important thing they could have explained are the wraiths that circle the top of the towers. The wraiths are wreathed in a shroud of darkness that causes all in it’s reach to fall into utmost despair, and occasionally chant  in some unknown language consisting of blood curdling screams that causes an irrational bone-chilling fear. The chief of the secret police reassures inhabitants that “There is no need to worry, as long as you DO NOT APPROACH THE TOWERS. For extra safety, keep your children indoors if you have not given a satisfactory sacrifice to the wraiths.” So there, readers, there is no threat from these watchtowers, as long as you continue to pay your taxes and have voted right in the last election. What a relief. I’m sure that in no time these watchtowers will become an important contributing part of our town.</p>

				<h1>Hillside Mayor Elections!</h1>
				<h3>Vote for the Next Hillside Mayor!</h3>
				<p>The mayoral elections are starting! In the article we will answer a few questions. One of the most important questions: Will online citizens get to vote and run for office? Yes, dear reader, online citizens will get to vote. However, Hillside officials feel that the Mayor should be in person to help our citizens in these troubled times. Another important question is: How shall the voting commence? Well, the mayoral candidates should announce it in disqus, then they shall write or record a speech and post it on the main page of the Hillside website. All citizens shall post their vote via disqus as well. We shall be eagerly awaiting your vote this election, and remember, if you don’t vote right, we have an insane asylum for a reason! Best of luck!</p>

    			<h1>Hillside Opening Once Again!</h1>
    			<h3>Hillside Will Open Soon, With Proper COVID-19 Precautions!</h3>
    			<p>Starting August 19, 2020 Y.D.(Year of Dispair) Hillside shall open up once again! However, we must ask you to follow certain saftey procedures. Mask wearing, sanitation, and ritual ceremonies shall be put into action along with other WHO suggested safty techniques. Remember that all these precautioins are are put into place for the safty of you and your fellow Hillside citizens, and to ensure that I don't get sick and die. My demise would be a major loss to the community, for then who would write these news articles? Well, I suppose the Assistant Editor and all the interns, but they are not yet fully ready, and have not yet earned their sarcasm certificates. Until they are ready, just please keep safe and make sure that our beloved town will survive throught these hard times.</p>
