				<h1>Hillside Mayor Elections!</h1>
				<h3>Vote for the Next Hillside Mayor!</h3>
				<p>The mayoral elections are starting! In the article we will answer a few questions. ONe of the most important questions: Will online citizens get to vote and run for office? Yes, dear reader, online citizens will get to vote. However, Hillside officials feel that the Mayor should be in person to help our citizens in these troubled times. Another important question is: How shall the voting commence? Well, the mayoral candidates should announce it in disqus, then they shall write or record a speech and post it on the main page of the Hillside website. All citizens shall post their vote via disqus as well. We shall be eagerly awaiting your vote this election, and remember, if you don’t vote right, we have an insane asylum for a reason! Best of luck!</p>

					<h1>New Sanitary System!</h1>
					<h3>Read About Hillside's Stunning New Sewage System!</h3>
					<p>Two of our new citizens have taken upon themselves a herculean task: the construction of a sewage system. They have begun to dig a channel alongside the roads to prevent flooding and to dispose of unwanted waste. As of this writing Raspberry Pass has a wonderful sewage system, and soon Sassafras Lane and Market Road will join the program. This will also solve the previous problem of soil erosion and muddy roads. Hillside prides itself as an environmentally advanced community and is glad to have solved this issue. This new sewage system may also lead to the creation of actual restrooms, which will be a major addition many members of the public have been asking for. Send in your suggestions for improvements or news <a href = "mailto: iloveplantsandfungi@gmail.com;thehobbit2006@outlook.com" class="default">here</a>. We give thanks to our new cosmopolitans for their dedication to our town.</p>

Remember that all these precautioins are are put into place for the safty of you and your fellow Hillside citizens, and to ensure that I don't get sick and die. My demise would be a major loss to the community, for then who would write these news articles? Well, I suppose the Assistant Editor and all the interns, but they are not yet fully ready, and have not yet earned their sarcasm certificates. Until they are ready, just please keep safe and make sure that our beloved town will survive throught these hard times.</p>
